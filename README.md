Python Code for Key Features
1. Web3 Interaction (Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain)

To interact with decentralized exchanges and track new meme coins, you need to use Web3.py:

from web3 import Web3

# Connect to the Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain node (for example, Infura or BSC node)
web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider('YOUR_INFURA_OR_BSC_PROVIDER_URL'))

# Check if connected
if web3.isConnected():
    print("Successfully connected to the blockchain!")

# Monitor new token creation by filtering contract creation events
def monitor_new_tokens():
    latest_block = web3.eth.blockNumber
    while True:
        current_block = web3.eth.blockNumber
        if current_block > latest_block:
            # Fetch the transactions in the latest block
            block = web3.eth.getBlock(current_block, full_transactions=True)
            for tx in block['transactions']:
                if 'create' in tx:
                    print(f"New token detected: {tx['creates']}")
                    # You can check the token contract here to gather more information
            latest_block = current_block

2. Social Media Sentiment Analysis

You can scrape Twitter or Reddit for sentiment analysis to gauge the meme coin’s popularity:

import tweepy
from textblob import TextBlob

# Authenticate to Twitter API
api_key = 'YOUR_TWITTER_API_KEY'
api_key_secret = 'YOUR_TWITTER_API_KEY_SECRET'
access_token = 'YOUR_TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN'
access_token_secret = 'YOUR_TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET'

auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(api_key, api_key_secret)
auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_token_secret)

api = tweepy.API(auth)

# Define a function to get sentiment of tweets
def get_sentiment(tweet):
    analysis = TextBlob(tweet.text)
    if analysis.sentiment.polarity > 0:
        return 'positive'
    elif analysis.sentiment.polarity < 0:
        return 'negative'
    else:
        return 'neutral'

# Get recent tweets mentioning a particular meme coin
def get_meme_coin_tweets(coin_name):
    public_tweets = api.search_tweets(coin_name, count=100)
    for tweet in public_tweets:
        sentiment = get_sentiment(tweet)
        print(f"Tweet: {tweet.text} | Sentiment: {sentiment}")

3. Trading Logic (with ccxt or custom DEX API)

You can use ccxt to trade on exchanges that support it (e.g., Uniswap, PancakeSwap):

import ccxt

# Initialize the exchange (e.g., Uniswap)
exchange = ccxt.binance({
    'apiKey': 'YOUR_API_KEY',
    'secret': 'YOUR_API_SECRET',
})

# Buy function (using Uniswap as an example)
def buy_token(symbol, amount):
    # Fetch the market details
    market = exchange.fetch_ticker(symbol)
    price = market['ask']  # Get the current ask price
    cost = price * amount
    order = exchange.create_market_buy_order(symbol, amount)
    print(f"Bought {amount} of {symbol} at price {price}")
    return order

# Sell function
def sell_token(symbol, amount):
    # Fetch the market details
    market = exchange.fetch_ticker(symbol)
    price = market['bid']  # Get the current bid price
    order = exchange.create_market_sell_order(symbol, amount)
    print(f"Sold {amount} of {symbol} at price {price}")
    return order

4. Risk Management (Stop-Loss, Rug-Pull Detection)

Implement risk management by adding safety mechanisms like stop-loss and rug-pull detection:

def stop_loss_check(current_price, purchase_price, stop_loss_percentage):
    if current_price <= purchase_price * (1 - stop_loss_percentage):
        print("Stop-loss triggered! Selling...")
        # Sell logic here
        sell_token('TOKEN_SYMBOL', amount)

def rug_pull_detection(transaction_volume, liquidity_pool):
    # If the liquidity pool is unusually low or transactions volume spikes drastically, this may indicate a rug-pull
    if transaction_volume / liquidity_pool > 0.5:  # This is an example threshold
        print("Potential rug-pull detected! Alerting user...")
        # Trigger alert
        send_alert('Potential rug-pull detected!')

5. Performance Tracking and Alerts

You can set up a simple monitoring system to track ROI and performance:

def track_performance(initial_investment, current_value):
    roi = (current_value - initial_investment) / initial_investment
    print(f"Current ROI: {roi * 100}%")
    return roi

def send_alert(message):
    # Send an alert to the user (can be via email, Telegram, etc.)
    print(f"ALERT: {message}")

Deployment on Cloud (AWS, GCP, or Azure)

    AWS/GCP/Azure: Deploy your bot on cloud platforms for scalability. Use services like EC2 or GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) for containerized deployments, and store logs in S3 or Google Cloud Storage.

    Security: Ensure that your bot handles API keys and wallet private keys securely, using encrypted storage (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, etc.).

Future Enhancements:

    Reinforcement Learning: Use RL algorithms to adapt trading strategies over time based on past experiences.
    Multi-Chain Support: Expand the bot to support multiple blockchains, such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Solana.
    Advanced Sentiment Analysis: Implement deeper NLP models (BERT, GPT-3) for sentiment analysis.

Timeline and Milestones:

    Week 1-2: Blockchain interaction, data collection, and initial trading logic.
    Week 3-4: Sentiment analysis integration, risk management features.
    Week 5-6: Trading strategies implementation, testing.
